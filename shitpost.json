  "2" : "I can't believe what you just said. What you just dared to utter out of the filthy recesses of your throat is so astronomically unbelievable that I've come the conclusion that you are a natural phenomenon. You literally possess the single most important discovery in all of science and human history. Your mouth is literally a generator of complete nonsense. Your vocal chords are actually a self propagating energy generator, capable of producing enough energy to power several city blocks infinitely. You have solved the issue scientists have spent years killing themselves over and have the answer to climate change and almost all of humanity's problems. Yet you choose to use this marvel of nature to be an absolute retard. This power endowed to you by what can only be a supernatural force is being used to spout infinite retardation online. You talk so much nonsense that I am positive you are no longer a living, conscious soul but are rather an infinitely charged retardo-bot. In conclusion, SHUT UP NIGGA GODDAMN!!",
  "3" : "Y'know, I must be honest with you. I like to catch the bees that fly in my garden and put them in my uterus. I can feel thrm fly around, trying to escape. Moralists would cry and say \"Bro, you are killing our most precious resource of food.\" I'm like. Yes bro, but. Have you ever tried? I bet that if you tried just once you would not stop. Once a bee stung me in my G-Zone area and I felt the poison flow thru my nerves and stimulate them so much I wouldn't stop squirting. The squirt ended up killing all the bees inside but it was still fun. I'm not even gonna tell you when I saw a 1 inch bee penis. Their penises are so god like, I swear. They can be so gentle yet so dominant. You ever feel like getting dominate? A bee's gonna do more than that. He will call you a slut, his sex slave and reduce your dignity to nothing. You heard me? Nothing.",
  "4" : "Today I was really horny and decided I was going to give the old Willy a treat, keep in mind I’ve never done this before. I saw a post on reddit about laying on your back and walking down the wall. I did this and I didn’t really get anything out of it, but after a while, I started getting the hang of it and it really wasn’t that bad. After a long time, I managed to reach the peak of the mountain and what I forgot about is the fact that I have to flip all the way back over if I want to let it out. I didn’t have time. I accidentally came in my mouth. You might think that’s where I fucked up but it’s not, I fucked up when I decided to drink a bottle of Gatorade directly before this whole event. As I spit out the contents of my mouth, I noticed the color was not normal. My entire sink was filled with blood red cum and I started to freak out. I looked down at my dick and saw that it, too, was covered in red. I passed out and when I came to, my back was awfully sore from the position I was in. Then it dawned on me that it was really just the Gatorade. TLDR; Tifu by drinking Gatorade and sucking my own dick, mistaking the red from the Gatorade as blood and passing out",
  "5" : "ALRIGHT. Downvote me all you want but I'm on day 3 of no nicotine and I'm about to fucking explode. How the FUCK does this shitty-ass joke get gilded and upvoted to infinity?! It got a chuckle out of me the first time I saw it like a month ago and it's already overused to shit. I'm not even one to get annoyed at overused reddit tropes normally but jesus you guys this shit is SO low effort it's actually unbelievable. Like even the most tired jokes on this site have some sort of reliance on context, you know like there had to be something there for you to connect the joke to in the first place. But no. Not this fucking peice of shit \"joke.\" You can just slap that dumbass comedic smut as a reply to literally any comment or post on this site and it \"works.\" Have we really devolved to this level or mindless circlejerkery?? I FEEL LIKE IM GOING CRAZY. FUCKING GILDED. FUCKS SAKE YOU GUYS WHO DID THIS.",
  "6" : "My lust for paper is un-fathomable. I get hard going into the staples paper section. Unboxing a fresh team of paper makes me want to just grab the entire stack and cum inside of it. The sheets get very soggy with the amount of cum I create. However, there is a downside. The paper cuts on my penis could not explain the pain one has when fucking paper. Though this is one of the downsides, the pink liquid made of a blood and semen mixture gives off a nice scent. The new ream of paper is destroyed but i, yes I, am a new man. A man of greater quality than before.",
