Moralists would cry and say \"Bro, you are killing our most precious resource of food.\" I'm like. Yes bro, but. Have you ever tried? I bet that if you tried just once you would not stop. Once a bee stung me in my G-Zone area and I felt the poison flow thru my nerves and stimulate them so much I wouldn't stop squirting. The squirt ended up killing all the bees inside but it was still fun. I'm not even gonna tell you when I saw a 1 inch bee penis. Their penises are so god like, I swear. They can be so gentle yet so dominant. You ever feel like getting dominate? A bee's gonna do more than that. He will call you a slut, his sex slave and reduce your dignity to nothing. You heard me? Nothing.",
